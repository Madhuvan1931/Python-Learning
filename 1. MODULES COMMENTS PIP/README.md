Today I started learning Python using the **CodeWithHarry YouTube tutorials**.  
I covered some important foundational topics that are useful for working with larger Python projects.

## âœ… Topics Covered:

### 1. âœ… **Modules in Python**
- A module is a Python file that contains definitions and statements.
- You can import and reuse functions, variables, and classes from other Python files or built-in modules.

**Example:**
```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(25))  # Output: 5.0
