# 🐍 Python Learning Journey - Day 2

### 📘 Topic: Variables and Data Types

---

## ✅ What I Learned Today

### 🔹 1. Variables in Python
- Variables are containers for storing data.
- Python is dynamically typed – no need to declare the type explicitly.
- Rules for naming variables:
  - Must start with a letter or underscore
  - Cannot start with a number
  - Are case-sensitive (e.g., `age` and `Age` are different)

### 🔹 2. What are Data Types?
- **Data types** define the type of value a variable can hold.
- Python is dynamically typed – it automatically detects the data type when you assign a value.

#### 🧪 Example:
```python
name = "Madhuvan"
age = 21
is_student = True
